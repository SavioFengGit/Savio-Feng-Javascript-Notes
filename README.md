#Introduction of Javascript
JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard. It is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages.

Here are some key points about JavaScript:
 - Web Interactivity: Every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved.
 - Core Web Technology: JavaScript is a core technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2024, 98.9% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior.
 - Dynamic Content: JavaScript enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and much more.
 - Event-Driven: JavaScript is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles.

## What are HTML and CSS ?
HTML, CSS and JavaScript are the three main languages of web development. They work together to define the structure, style and behavior of a web page.

- HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) is the language that defines the content and the semantic meaning of a web page. It uses tags to mark different elements, such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, forms, etc.
- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the language that defines the appearance and layout of a web page. It uses rules to apply styles to HTML elements, such as colors, fonts, backgrounds, borders, margins, etc.
